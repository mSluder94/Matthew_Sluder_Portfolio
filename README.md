# Matthew_Sluder_Portfolio
For Firefli


I have a project from my Web Design I class in which I made a web page from scratch out of pure HTML and CSS. Before I got started on the code I used balsamiq mockups to create a rough sketch of my website idea. Then after I created the actual web page I created a documentation file. The whole time I worked on the project I also kept a time log. I have also included two netbeans zip files from my JavaScript Class. These two projects were given to us with the all of the HTMLand CSS already written.  We just had to write the majority of the JavaScript and JQuery Code to get it working like it was supposed to. The 'msluder140mod5' file is a product 'carousel' of some of our textbooks. If you click on them they fade in and out. The 'msluder140mod8' file has a form validation page which checks that each entry is valid using a pattern. Once you enter valid information it just posts it to the next page. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
 Matt
